# 2018 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey Analysis

Starting from 2017 Kaggle conducts global Data Science and Machine Learning survey among data professions, with an intention to establish a comprehensive view of the state of the field.

By taking advantage of Kaggle survey data, this notebook aims at concentrating on a particular subgroup of respondents – professionals with undergraduate major in business discipline, who changed or in the proses of changing their career into Data Science/Data Analytics and comparing them with professionals coming from other backgrounds. In context of this paper respondents coming from Business background are simply called “switchers” and the rest “others”. 

Major research question is how different the switchers are from others. The paper has the following objectives for analysis of survey data:
1.	To establish a view of what is going on in the Data Scientist field.
2.	In particular, compare respondents coming from Business discipline with others 


### About Survey  

Kaggle launched 2018 survey in October for one week and dataset was made public in November. Consequently, it is a recent survey and its data have been available for short period of time when this paper was written. According to Kaggle this industry-wide survey presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. Survey received 23859 respondents (49% increase over 2017) from 147 countries. Country receiving less than 50 responses was grouped under “Other”. Survey touched such areas as education, learning sources, career, skills, technologies, programming languages, data types, as well as, state of Machine Learning. Respondents were primarily found from Kaggle channels, emails, forums and social media. 

There were two types of questions - multiple choice and free form (where people could submit their desired answer). To protect the respondent privacy, the answers to multiple choice questions were separated into a separate data file from the open-ended responses.
